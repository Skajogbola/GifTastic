Description: 

Use the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice. To finish this task, you must call the GIPHY API and use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of your site.

Here's the solution:

I created an sport App full of gifs using the giphy api.  
I made an array of the types of sports and made buttons out of them.  
When you click on a button, 10 images are retrieved from giphy and displayed on the page.  
When you click on the image, the gif plays. When you click again, the gif stops playing.  
The player can add a new sport from the form on the right side of the page. The actions will be added as a button to the array of the types of sports.  
The rating of each gif will also appear.  

Technical approach:

To finish this task, I created the html and CSS (using Bootstrap) files and called the GIPHY API. I also used JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of my site.
